📝 Smart ClaimMate – Written Problem & Solution Statement
Problem:
Filing and resolving insurance claims—especially health-related ones—can be time-consuming, confusing, and emotionally taxing. Users often don’t understand the denial reasons, are unsure of what documents are needed, and have no guidance on the next steps. This lack of clarity results in stress, delays, and poor customer experience across healthcare, automobile, and even banking sectors.

Target Users:
Smart ClaimMate is designed for individuals navigating complex insurance processes—patients, caregivers, vehicle owners, and bank customers. It especially supports those who lack technical expertise or insurance literacy and need an intuitive, AI-driven guide.

Creative & Useful Solution:
Smart ClaimMate is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered virtual assistant that simplifies the insurance journey through personalized conversation, AI reasoning, and helpful visual insights.

🎯 What makes it creative?

💬 Users can chat naturally with the bot to understand policies, rejections, and next steps

📬 It drafts dispute or appeal emails based on the user's situation and tone preference

📍 If unsure about treatment options, users can enter their ZIP code and receive:

Suggested nearby hospitals within 10 miles

🏥 Hospital name, ratings, wheelchair access, plan compatibility, cost, doctor info, and availability

📄 It lists required documents for approval

📊 After uploading, it gives a prediction score on approval likelihood (trust score)

❌ For denials, it explains the core issue and recommends corrective documents

💡 The best part? By changing the system prompt, Smart ClaimMate can be adapted for:

🚗 Automobile insurance claim assistance

🏦 Bank-related claim guidance and document support

This flexibility makes it a truly modular and scalable assistant across sectors.
